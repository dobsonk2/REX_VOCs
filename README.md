# Introduction

This repository contains R scripts that clean, analyze, and plot data from the VOC collection study in the KBS-LTER Rainfall Exclusion Experiment (REX). Plant VOCs were collected from Solidago altissima in ambient, drought, warmed, and warmed + drought conditions. Plants had been warmed for 20 months continuously and were in a 3-week drought at the time of VOC sampling.

## Spatiotemporal extent

Spatial extent: Kellogg Biological Station's Main Cropping System Experiment in Hickory Corners, MI, USA
Temporal extent: July 11-15 2022

## Scripts

2022_VOCs_clean: takes raw VOC data after pre-processing with the Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis 10.0 program and cleans the data by normalizing abudance values, removing background controls, transforming from wide to long, etc.
2022_leaf_biomass: calculates an estimate of total leaf biomass sampled by regression leaf length with leaf biomass
2022_VOCs_analysis: statistical analyses for the VOC data
2022_VOCs_plots: figures for the VOC data
